          Pokémon also known as Pocket Monsters in Japan, is a Japanese media
          franchise managed by The Pokémon Company, a company founded by
          Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. The franchise was created by
          Satoshi Tajiri in 1995, and is centered on fictional creatures called
          "Pokémon", which humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch and train to
          battle each other for sport. Works within the franchise are set in the
          Pokémon universe. The English slogan for the franchise is "Gotta Catch
          'Em All".

          The name Pokémon is the portmanteau of the Japanese brand Pocket
          Monsters. The term "Pokémon", in addition to referring to the Pokémon
          franchise itself, also collectively refers to the 898 fictional
          species that have made appearances in Pokémon media as of the release
          of the eighth generation titles Pokémon Sword and Shield. "Pokémon" is
          identical in the singular and plural, as is each individual species
          name; it is grammatically correct to say "one Pokémon" and "many
          Pokémon", as well as "one Pikachu" and "many Pikachu"
