      humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch and train to battle each other
      for sport. Works within the franchise are set in the Pokémon universe. The
      English slogan for the franchise is "Gotta Catch 'Em All".

      The name Pokémon is the portmanteau of the Japanese brand Pocket Monsters.
      The term "Pokémon", in addition to referring to the Pokémon franchise
      itself, also collectively refers to the 898 fictional species that have
      made appearances in Pokémon media as of the release of the eighth
      generation titles Pokémon Sword and Shield. "Pokémon" is identical in the
      singular and plural, as is each individual species name; it is
      grammatically correct to say "one Pokémon" and "many Pokémon", as well as
      "one Pikachu" and "many Pikachu"
