    <h2>The three app pillars</h2>
    <p>
      Progressive Web Apps are web applications that have been designed so they
      are capable, reliable, and installable. These three pillars transform them
      into an experience that feels like a platform-specific application.

    <h3>Capable</h3>
    <p>
      The web is quite capable in its own right today. For example, you can
      build a hyper-local video chat app using WebRTC, geolocation, and push
      notifications. You can make that app installable and take those
      conversations virtual with WebGL and WebVR. With the introduction of Web
      Assembly, developers can tap into other ecosystems, like C, C++, and Rust,
      and bring decades of work and capabilities to the web too. Squoosh.app,
      for instance, leverages this for its advanced image compression.

    <h3>Reliable</h3>
    <p>
      A reliable Progressive Web App feels fast and dependable regardless of the
      network. Speed is critical for getting users to use your experience. In
      fact, as page load times go from 1 second to ten seconds, the probability
      of a user bouncing increases by 123%. Performance doesn't stop after the
      onload event. Users should never wonder whether their interaction—for
      example, clicking a button—was registered or not. Scrolling and animation
      should feel smooth. Performance affects your entire experience, from how
      users perceive your application to how it actually performs.

    <h3>Installable</h3>
    <p>
      Installed Progressive Web Apps run in a standalone window instead of a
      browser tab. They're launchable from on the user's home screen, dock,
      taskbar, or shelf. It's possible to search for them on a device and jump
      between them with the app switcher, making them feel like part of the
      device they're installed on.
